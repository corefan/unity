# 3rd Person Shooter

**Note:** In order for this game to function properly, there needs to be a folder within the Project Assets titled `AssetStore` and then within there you will need the following:

 - SimplePeople
 - SimpleSky
 - SimpleTown
 - SimpleZombies

All of which can be found in the Unity AssetStore.  I purchased them personally which is why they are not included in this Github repo.

Game works best with an Xbox 360 wired controller.  Left Stick to move around, Right stick to aim (twin stick shooter).  Left/Right bumper buttons will rotate the game world left/right by 90 degrees.

Zombies will give chase and use properly pathfinding.

Still very much an extremely early work in progress.
